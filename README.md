# Number Guessing Game 🎲

A basic but entertaining Number Guessing Game written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is my first step into the realm of JavaScript programming, and it illustrates the fundamental ideas I've learned thus far.

## Description 📝

The Number Guessing Game is a single-page web application where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. With each attempt, the game provides hints, guiding the user closer to the correct number. Challenge yourself to find the number with the fewest attempts and beat your own highscore!

## How to Play 🎮

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. You'll see an input field to enter your guess and a stylish "Submit" button.
4. Try to guess the number between 1 and 20.
5. After each guess, the game will provide a hint if the correct number is higher or lower, presented in a visually appealing way.
6. Continue guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts.

## Learning Outcome 📚

Working on this project has been a valuable learning experience for me. Here are the key takeaways from this project:

1. **Front-End Web Development:** I gained hands-on experience in building a responsive and interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. **Event Listening:** I became proficient in using event listeners to respond to user interactions, such as button clicks and form submissions, to trigger specific actions in the application.

3. **Loops and Conditionals:** I leveraged loops and conditional statements to implement the game logic, handle user inputs, and provide hints during the number-guessing process.

4. **DOM Manipulation:** I deepened my understanding of Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, allowing me to dynamically update elements and provide user feedback.

5. **User Experience (UX):** I focused on creating an intuitive and visually appealing user interface to enhance the overall user experience.
